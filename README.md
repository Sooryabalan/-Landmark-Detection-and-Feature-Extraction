# Kathakali Bhava Classification Project - Landmark Detection and Feature Extraction

Welcome to the Landmark Detection and Feature Extraction component of the Kathakali Bhava Classification project. This part of the project focuses on extracting facial landmarks from Kathakali Bhava videos and calculating relevant features for further analysis.

## Project Overview

In this phase of the project, we perform the following tasks:

- Video processing to extract frames at regular intervals.
- Face landmark detection using the dlib library.
- Calculation of eight key features from each frame, including Eye Aspect Ratio, Mouth Aspect Ratio, etc.
- Storage of feature data in CSV files corresponding to each class and video.

## Getting Started

To use this code and reproduce the feature extraction process, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python script (`feature_extraction.ipynb` or `feature_extraction.py`).
3. Follow the instructions within the notebook/script to execute the feature extraction process.

## Requirements

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook (if using the notebook)
- dlib library
- OpenCV (for video processing)

## Project Structure

- `feature_extraction.ipynb` or `feature_extraction.py`: The main script or notebook for landmark detection and feature extraction.
- `data/`: Directory containing the CSV files storing the extracted features.
- `samples/`: Sample videos or frames for testing and demonstration.
